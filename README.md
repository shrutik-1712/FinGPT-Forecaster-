# FinGPT-Forecaster

FinGPT-Forecaster is a Python-based data pipeline and market prediction tool that integrates Indian stock market data and news for predictive analytics. The project uses **yfinance** to fetch stock data and the **Google News API** to gather related news, feeding this data into a custom solution powered by pre-existing LLM weights for accurate forecasting.

This project is inspired by the [FinGPT](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinGPT/tree/master/fingpt/FinGPT_Forecaster) framework developed by the AI4Finance Foundation, with modifications tailored to the Indian stock market.

## Features

- **Stock Data Integration**: Fetches real-time stock data from **yfinance**.
- **News Data Integration**: Retrieves relevant market news using the **Google News API**.
- **Market Prediction**: Utilizes a custom language model (LLM) pipeline to forecast Indian stock market trends.
- **Google Colab Deployment**: Easily deploys the solution on **Google Colab**, enabling easy access and execution for users.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **yfinance**: For fetching Indian stock market data.
- **Google News API**: To collect news data relevant to market trends.
- **Transformers**: For processing data and applying the LLM-based model.
- **Google Colab**: For deployment and easy access.
